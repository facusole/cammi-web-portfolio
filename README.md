## Personal website ðŸ’» 
This project is a collaboration with Product Designer <a href='https://www.behance.net/russocamila' rel='noopener nofollow noreferrer' target='_blank'>Camila Russo</a>. She came up with the design and I recreated it using React.

<br/>

## How do we work

We've worked together in some projects and we always worked the same way:
- She comes up with the designs and the interactions inside the websites/projects and sends me the Figma file.

- I begin creating the base project and the github repository. I also make some html structure and basic styling first.

- We communicate back and forth while trying some new ideas that we come up with during the process.

- I finish recreating the design and I present to her so she can give me feedback about what can be improved.

- We add some final details.

- The project gets launched! ðŸš€

## Final thoughts
Recreating this website's been both fun and challenging. Working with Camila it's so easy. She gives good and solid feedback while being kind and honest. <br/><br/>
I hope you like the website! ðŸ’–

## Personal website ðŸ’» 
This project is a collaboration with Product Designer <a href='https://www.behance.net/russocamila' rel='noopener nofollow noreferrer' target='_blank'>Camila Russo</a>. She came up with the design and I recreated using React as my main framework.<br/>

## How did we work

We've worked together in some projects and we always worked the same way:
- She comes up with the designs and the interactions inside the websites/projects and sends me the Figma file.
- I begin creating the base project and the github repository. I also make some html structure and basic styling first.
- We communicate back and forth while trying some new ideas that we come up with during the process.
- I finish recreating the design and I present to her so she can give me feedback about what can be improved.
- The project gets launched!
